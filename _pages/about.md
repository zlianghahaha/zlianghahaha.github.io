I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/), 
[University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), under the supervision of 
[Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/) at the University of Notre Dame. I also work closely with 
[Prof. Yongshan Ding](https://www.yongshanding.com/) at Yale University, 
[Prof. Weiwen Jiang](https://jqub.github.io/) at George Mason University, and 
[Prof. Tongyang Li](https://www.tongyangli.com/) at Peking University.

I received my Bachelor's degree from [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in Madison, WI, US, where I worked with 
[Professor Juda Shohet](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Shohet_J-/) in the Plasma Processing & Technology lab at UW-Madison.

<!-- Please check my [CV](CV_ZhidingLiang.pdf) for more details. -->

<font color="red">I will join Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor! I have fully funded PhD openings in my group for Spring/Fall 2025, if you are admitted to RPI at Fall 2024 and still in rotation, you can also feel free to contact with me!</font>

# Research
My research interests recently focus on quantum computing, including:
- **Hardware Softerware Co-design for Quantum Computing From Gate level to Pulse level**
- **Efficient Quantum Error Mitigation and Benchmarking at Pulse level**

I am also interested in outreach and education in software and system level quantum computing. I am organizing the [Quantum Computer System Lecture Series (QuCS)](https://sites.nd.edu/quantum/). Additionally, I am leading the organization of the [2023 ACM/IEEE Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge](https://qccontest.github.io/QC-Contest/index.html) at the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design ([ICCAD 2023](https://iccad.com/index.php/)).
