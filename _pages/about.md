I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu//), under the supervision of [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/) at University of Notre Dame. I also closely work with [Prof. Yongshan Ding](https://www.yongshanding.com/) at Yale University, [Prof. Weiwen Jiang](https://jqub.github.io/) at George Mason University, and [Prof. Tongyang Li](https://www.tongyangli.com/) at Peking University. <br> 
I received my Bachelor's degree from [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in Madison, WI, US, where I was worked with [Professor. Juda Shohet](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Shohet_J-/) in the Plasma Processing & Technology lab at UW-Madison.

Please check my [CV](CV_ZhidingLiang.pdf) for details.

# Research
My research interests recently focus on quantum computing: 
- **Pulse Ansatz and Pulse Learning for Variational Quantum Algorithm** 
- **Efficient Crosslayer Ansatz by Hardware and Software Co-design**

 I am also interested in outreach and education in software and system level quantum computing. I have organizing the [Quantum Computer System Lecture Series (QuCS)](https://sites.nd.edu/quantum/). I am also lead to organize the [2023 ACM/IEEE Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge](https://qccontest.github.io/QC-Contest/index.html) at International Conference on Computer-Aided Design ([ICCAD 2023](https://iccad.com/index.php/)).
